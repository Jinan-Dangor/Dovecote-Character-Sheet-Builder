## Work in Progress

This project is currently a work in progress. Not all listed features may be functional.

## Build a Character Sheet

Build a character sheet customised for web, mobile or print. Generate light and dark mode colour palettes for aesthetic customisation. Link to custom images and fonts for total control.

## Share your Sheet

Use a URL or QR code to share your sheets with your players. Updated a sheet? Use version control to send out an updated version, and update your sheet automatically!

## Make a Character

Fill out your available character sheets to make any number of characters. Send your sheets to your GM so they can have them open during play.

## Play a TRPG!

Make automatic summaries of your players' sheets so that important stats are readily available. Make some macros for your most common dice rolls and use them in the dice roller.
